## Getting Started

Again, I recommend just using the CustomGPT directly on OpenAI's website, but I am working on making downloable in Pyhton

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` (probably, still haven't finished the project)

### Installation

WORK IN PROGRESS
